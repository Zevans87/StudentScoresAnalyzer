# StudentScoresAnalyzer
Programming Fundamentals II â€“ College Assignment

Project Overview - This C++ program was created to demonstrate dynamic memory allcoation and array encapsulation
through a custom-built class called "SuperArray". This was created while at UHV for Programming Fundamentals II. 
This system was designed to manage and analyze student scores across multiple programming courses using structured
and object-oriented programming concepts.

Objectives of the program - To implement a reusable class that manages arrays dynamically and populate course data
from file input while demonstrating encapsulation, pointer usage, and structered programming practices.

Files - 
  * Class header file : SuperArray.h
  * Class implementation file : SuperArray.cpp
  * Main program logic and test driver : SuperArrayTest.cpp
  * Input file with score data for each course : scores.txt
